Stochastic production frontier with exogenous and endogenous variables in one and two-step

Here we present two stochastic production frontier models with endogenous variables based on main distributions for the technical inefficiency: half-normal, exponential, and truncated normal distributions. 
Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient vectors from the log-likelihood function of the models to obtain the best performance at a reasonable computational time cost. 
The methodology presented here is based on one and two-step maximum likelihood estimation and is implemented on the R language. 
To obtain consistent estimates in this scenario, we created commands to allow the use of models in the presence or not of endogeneity and heteroscedasticity in relation to one or both error terms.
